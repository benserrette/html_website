# Why You Need a Nemesis

But what if there's nobody to teach you to fish?  What are you supposed to do then?  You find your nemesis instead.

A lot of career advice given to newbies in any industry is to "find a mentor".  A mentor can help you learn new skills and give you a leg up in unfamiliar territory.  Mentorship is even required for a lot of professions, like plumbers or surgeons.  In my profession (computer programming and web development), having a mentor is great but not required, though, a lot of senior level job listings now have "mentoring and coaching" as one of the enumerated responsibilities.

Of course, I never got that memo.  I got dumped into the web dev industry cold with no one to hold my hand or point out my mistakes.  While Google was a great assistant to an inexperienced young coder, it could only really teach me things already I knew to ask it.  But despite not having a professional mentor of any kind, I still managed to grow and improve and be (relatively) successful in my career.  I didn't get here alone, though.  I found my nemesis.

In Greek mythology, Nemesis was a goddess of divine retribution.  More commonly, the word [_nemesis_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nemesis) refers to "a formidable and usually victorious rival or opponent".  In the context of this post, a nemesis is that person or company or tool that just irks you and frustrates you so much that it forces you to improve yourself for no other reason than to do better than.  A nemesis is essentially an anti-mentor.

Where a mentor can give you the tools and training you need, a nemesis will give you a reason.  More than that, a nemesis will cause enough friction and challenge you enough to make you rethink the values that make you who you are.  It's your nemesis that sparks insight, self reflection, and self reliance.  Your mentor might give you everything you need to be successful, but you're not going to grow as a person by doing it the way it's always been done.

Let's look at an example from pop culture (_nerd alert_): The X-Men.

Despite his flaws, Professor X is the classic, archetypal mentor.  He raised and trained the X-men.  He taught them to harness their powers and instilled in them an appreciation of life and harmony and the desire to live along side humans.

In their quest to protect humans, the X-Men often clashed with their long time nemesis, Magneto.  Magneto had a much more militant approach, with political views touching on Mutant superiority.  It was in their battles with the Master of Magnetism that the X-Men pushed their skills further, forced to adapt and improvise in the moment.  Magneto's anti-human rhetoric also pushed them to question and relfect on Xavier's teachings, offering an alternate viewpoint and allowing them to make up their own minds.

A more nuanced relationship, and one that perhaps better exemplifies the type of nemesis I'm talking about here, is the one between Wolverine and Cyclops.  While on the same team with the same goal, they were constantly at odds, yet this conflict had a profound impact on both of them.

Wolverine started out as the gruff anti-hero: An outsider with a contempt for authority and instincts built from years of self-reliance and survival.  Cyclops, on the other hand, was Xavier's star student: by-the-book, diciplined, obedient, laser-focused on pursuing Xavier's dream to the letter.  Two incredibly different characters, forced to work and live together, clashing at every turn over everything from tactics and girls to the very definition of what it means to be an X-man.

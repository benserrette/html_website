                    The Collaborative Archive &amp; Data Research Environment (CADRE) addresses the critical issue of providing sustainable, affordable, and standardized data and text mining services for licensed big data sets.

                CADRE features a number of complimentary pieces. The web-based interface is hosted on AWS and uses several services to connect the frontend with the middleware and databases.

            <p>
                As lead software engineer I directed the IUNI IT Team in the design and implementation of the CADRE Gateway. The frontend was built with Vue.js and Bootstrap, while asynchronous database queries ran via AWS SQS.
            </p>
            <p>
                The marketing site uses the flat-file CMS Grav and AWS SNS for contact forms. After becoming Director of IT I successfully brokered a deal to sunset the project, saving significant resources.

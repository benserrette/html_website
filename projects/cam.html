                    The Conference Agenda Manager (CAM) allows conference administrators to provide attendees with a searchable database of events. Attendees can build and share customized agendas without creating an account.

                The front-end was created with Quasar and intended for compilation into a native mobile app. Backend services were written in PHP with a MySQL database.

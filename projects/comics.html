            <p>I have enjoyed comics since I was a youth, both reading and creating them. Below is a collection of comics I've created over the years, some dating back to 2004.</p>
            <h2 class="nsfw">Toilet Humor and Dick Jokes</h2>
            <p>The site is hosted on <a href="https://thadj.neocities.org/" target="_blank">Neocities</a> because it reminds me of the glory days of GeoCities.</p>
            <h2>Strips 4 Singles</h2>
            <p>I devised Strips 4 Singles as a way to encourage drawing by taking $1 commissions. A gallery of some of the strips can be found <a href="strips-4-singles.html">here</a>.</p>
            <h2>24 Hour Comic Day 2014</h2>
            <p>24 Hour Comic Day is a yearly event where cartoonists create comics from start to finish in 24 consecutive hours. I participated in 2014 and almost succeeded, finishing the next day.</p>
            <h2 class="nsfw">Poonheads</h2>
            <p>My first foray into web comics followed the bizarre misadventures of three friends. The archive can be found at <a href="https://poonheads.com" target="_blank">poonheads.com</a>.</p>

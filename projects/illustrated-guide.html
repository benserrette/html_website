            <p>This book was an assignment for an instructional design course. The requirement was to create a fully illustrated booklet of at least 16 pages. As both a programmer and an illustrator, I merged the two to create a primer explaining the basics of computer programming using lengthy illustrations instead of paragraphs.</p>
            <p>Programming cannot really be explained in 16 pages, so the project soon ballooned to around 100 pages.</p>
            <p>I consider this volume&nbsp;1 in a series. The deadline approached before I could tackle advanced topics. I hope to eventually complete this book or create a volume&nbsp;2, and find a cost-effective way to publish it.</p>

            <p><a href="cadre.html">The CADRE project</a> was funded by a grant from the IMLS. To support the proposal, we needed an eye-catching introduction video explaining the problem and our proposed solution.</p>
            <p>With limited resources, the IUNI IT Team brainstormed a "whiteboard" style animation because it could be produced quickly with off-the-shelf software. I created the visuals, tracing drawings into Illustrator and importing them into the animation software.</p>
            <p>The script was a collaboration between the principal investigators and our data manager, who also provided the narration thanks to his British accent.</p>
            <p>The entire process was completed in under a week and is widely believed to have been a major factor in the success of our grant proposal.</p>

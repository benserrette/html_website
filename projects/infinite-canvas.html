            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>This project explores bringing Scott McCloud's idea of the Infinite Canvas into the social arena of Web&nbsp;2.0.</p>
            <p>The prototype was built using JQuery.</p>
            <p>The final paper can be found <a href="/assets/files/Capstone_paper.pdf" target="_blank">here (.pdf, 3.49MB)</a>.</p>
            <p>The final presentation can be viewed <a href="/assets/files/Capstone_presentation.pdf" target="_blank">here (.pdf, 11.6MB)</a>. A video of the final presentation can be found at <a href="http://vimeo.com/13216700" target="_blank">vimeo.com/13216700</a>.</p>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Comics as most people think about them have been around since the late 1700s. They range from short political cartoons to super hero comic books to graphic novels.</p>
            <p>Comics is, however, a much more diverse medium. Will Eisner defined comics as "sequential art". Scott McCloud expands this with his own definition of "juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence." Under these definitions, the word "comics" can be applied to early cave paintings and Egyptian hieroglyphics.</p>
            <p>The most recent format for comics is the web comic. Web comics are, as the name implies, comics posted on the web. While web comics can be traced back to Usenet, they became popular in the late 1990s with the start of such comics as Penny Arcade and PVP.</p>
            <p>Until recently, comics were confined to the physical dimensions of the medium that the comic is created in. In 1999, McCloud introduced the concept commonly known as the Infinite Canvas. Screens could be used as windows to view a comic, allowing panels to be placed in any direction and size, virtually without limit.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, with the exception of a few experimental comics, the infinite canvas never took off. McCloud attributed this to both technical and mental limitations. At the time screen sizes were limited and broadband access was rare.</p>
            <p>Today we live in the world of Web&nbsp;2.0. There is no reason the Infinite Canvas cannot take advantage of dynamic sites and social media to become a rich, interactive experience.</p>

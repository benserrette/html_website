                <h2>What is the Observatory on Social Media?</h2>
                <p>
                    The Observatory on Social Media (OSoMe, pronounced awe&bull;some) is a joint project of the Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research at the Luddy School, the Media School, and the Network Science Institute at Indiana University. OSoMe unites data scientists and journalists in studying the role of media and technology in society, and building tools to analyze and counter disinformation and manipulation on social media.

                OSoMe was originally created as a sophisticated data collection and storage system to archive the Twitter stream. Over time, OSoMe expanded into a set of tools used to combat misinformation on Twitter.

            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>
                My initial contribution to OSoMe was the <a href="http://osome.iuni.iu.edu/tools/networks/" target="_blank">Diffusion Network Graph</a>. The interface was created using Angular and Zurb Foundation while the middleware used Python and NetworkX.
            </p>
            <p>
                As OSoMe's mission grew, so did my role. I led the development of the <a href="hoaxy.html">Hoaxy</a> frontend, mentored junior developers, and oversaw the creation of BotSlayer. I continue to guide the technical strategy for OSoMe's tools.

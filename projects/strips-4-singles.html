            <p>I like drawing, but never really have a reason or the drive, so I devised Strips 4 Singles as a way to solve both problems. People submit things for me to draw, and since they pay for them, I’m obligated to create.</p>
            <p>Obviously, with at most $9 per project, it’s not very sustainable financially, but the intention was not to make money off of it.</p>
            <p>The website was originally built with Ruby on Rails, but is now defunct. Want your own Strip 4 Singles? Hit me up and we can work something out.</p>

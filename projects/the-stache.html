            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The Stache was created in 2009 using RPG Maker VX for an Interactive Storytelling course at Indiana University.</p>
            <p>Its story revolves around a man named Barry who wakes up with his award winning mustache missing from his face. Barry must go around town, interact with citizens, and discover what happened to the 'stache. Along the way, he collects famous mustaches which grant him their powers.</p>

                <p><strong>Protip</strong></p>
                <p>The game's theme is about accepting who you really are, so the less you wear a mustache, the stronger you get!</p>
            </aside>
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>The adventure-game style gameplay was inspired by titles like Leisure Suit Larry. RPG Maker was chosen to allow the team to focus on story rather than learning a new engine.</p>
            <p>The code and binary can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/benabus/the-stache">Github Repository</a>.</p>

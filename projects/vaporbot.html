                <p>Born in cyberspace, with roots in punk rock, a foundation in computer science, and more than a pinch of sci-fi futurism, VaporBot produces a unique brand of artificially improvisational synthetic jazz-wave, called robowave, that's great for chilling, studying, or sleeping.</p>

            <p>Inspired by the niche electronic musical genre of Vaporwave, I created a Python script to generate songs and upload them to YouTube.</p>
            <p>Later versions added additional synths and generated audio via scripted MIDI. The video components pulled random images and applied glitch effects. "Yosemite.txt" was the first to use actual video, rather than a still image.</p>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@vaporbot1563" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> was automated and has over 400 songs. The <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/33j52yIanizX23TDXHQ41I?si=8vdfZRbUTGuGyu1kmAG_qg" target="_blank">Spotify channel</a> hosts several albums.</p>
            <p>At some point, the bot aspect took a backseat to the music aspect. Much of the code now lives in a Jupyter notebook that I use to just make music.</p>

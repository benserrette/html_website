# About Me

I'm a hands-on engineering leader with almost 20 years of experience building software, guiding teams, and helping people do their best work. As Director of IT and Engineering at the <a href="https://osome.iu.edu" target="_blank">Observatory on Social Media (OSoMe)</a>, I lead a small but mighty team that creates research tools for studying misinformation, social bots, and online influence. Our work supports researchers, journalists, and policymakers trying to make sense of a complicated digital world.

My leadership style is simple: take care of your team, and they'll take care of the software. I believe in hiring smart, passionate developers and helping them grow into the best engineers they can be. I focus on creating a collaborative, supportive environment where people feel safe to try things, learn from mistakes, and ship meaningful work. I try to balance long-term strategy with practical execution, keeping one eye on the big picture and the other on what's shipping next week.

I value trust, autonomy, and a strong sense of purpose. I don't micromanage, but I'm always there when my team needs support. We move fast, iterate often, and try to build things that are not just functional, but actually useful. Maybe even a little enjoyable.

When I'm not building software or helping others do the same, I'm probably listening to music, playing tabletop RPGs, or working on a LEGO set.

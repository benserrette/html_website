## Collaborative Archive and Data Research Environment

 > The Collaborative Archive & Data Research Environment (CADRE) addresses the critical issue of providing sustainable, affordable, and standardized data and text mining services for licensed big data sets.
 
CADRE features a number of complimentary pieces. The web-based interface is hosted on AWS and uses several services to connect the frontend with the middleware and databases.

As lead software engineer I directed the IUNI IT Team in the design and implementation of the CADRE Gateway. The frontend was built with Vue.js and Bootstrap, while asynchronous database queries ran via AWS SQS.

The marketing site uses the flat-file CMS Grav and AWS SNS for contact forms. After becoming Director of IT I successfully brokered a deal to sunset the project, saving significant resources.

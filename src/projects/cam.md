## The Conference Agenda Manager

> The Conference Agenda Manager (CAM) allows conference administrators to provide attendees with a searchable database of events. Attendees can build and share customized agendas without creating an account.

CAM was built at IUNI for NetSci 2017 and used again for NetSci 2018.

The front-end was created with Quasar and intended for compilation into a native mobile app. Backend services were written in PHP with a MySQL database.

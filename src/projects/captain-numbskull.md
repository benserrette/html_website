title: Captain Numbskull
---

> Space. It’s cold, it’s dark, and it goes on forever. There is an infinite number of points in the space between here and there. At each point there awaits untold dangers and unforeseeable peril. Few men dare to brave this great emptiness alone. Our good captain is one of them and no amount of space will keep him from the adventure that lies ahead.

Captain Numbskull in Space is a comic book about a bumbling space pirate and his exploits in space.

Numbskull was originally created as a random filler comic for The Vermilion during the summer of 2005. The concept was so appealing that I continued sketching Numbskull until finally creating a comic book based on the character.

The comic was finally completed and, thanks to a successful Kickstarter, printed in 2014.

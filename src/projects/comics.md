## Storytelling with Sequential Art

I have enjoyed comics since I was a youth, both reading and creating them. Below is a collection of comics I've created over the years, some dating back to 2004.

### Toilet Humor and Dick Jokes (nsfw)

The site is hosted on <a href="https://thadj.neocities.org/" target="thadj">Neocities</a> because it reminds me of the glory days of GeoCities.

### Strips 4 Singles

I devised Strips 4 Singles as a way to encourage drawing by taking $1 commissions. A gallery of some of the strips can be found <a href="strips-4-singles">here</a>.

### 24 Hour Comic Day 2014

24 Hour Comic Day is a yearly event where cartoonists create comics from start to finish in 24 consecutive hours. I participated in 2014 and almost succeeded, finishing the next day.

### Poonheads (nsfw)

My first foray into web comics followed the bizarre misadventures of three friends. The archive can be found at <a href="https://poonheads.com" target="poonheads">poonheads.com</a>.

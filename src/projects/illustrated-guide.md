## An Illustrated Guide to Programming for Absolute Beginners and the Computer Illiterate

This book was an assignment for an instructional design course. The requirement was to create a fully illustrated booklet of at least 16 pages. As both a programmer and an illustrator, I merged the two to create a primer explaining the basics of computer programming using lengthy illustrations instead of paragraphs.

Of course, the basics of programming can't really be explained in 16 pages, so the finished book came in at around 100 pages.

You can download the contents [here (PDF)](/assets/files/Illustrated_Guide_To_Programming.pdf).
